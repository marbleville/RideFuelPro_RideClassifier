This section of RideFuelPro is the data preprocessor.

This section take the RideEntry from the classifier and processes it into a 
reduced set of data points that are more easily analyzed by the neural network.

From the RideEntry, the preprocessor will extract the following data points:
- Distance
- moving_time
- total_elevation_gain
- distance_uphill
- distance_downhill
- average_uphill_gradient
- average_downhill_gradient
- workout_type

moving_time will be hidden for the test data set.
